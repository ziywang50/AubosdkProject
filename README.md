# Robotic Arm Development – Internship Project (Summer 2022)

This project was part of my internship at Zhongxiangying Technology in Beijing. I worked with a robotic arm using the Aubo SDK in C++ to automate physical tasks based on visual input.

## What I Worked On

- Wrote C++ code to control the robotic arm’s movement through the Aubo SDK
- Set up hand-eye calibration by translating coordinates from a camera to the robot’s movement system
- Used YOLOv5 for object detection so the robot could “see” and react to its environment

The goal was to have the robot identify and interact with objects using real-time visual input, with precise control. I also worked on improving the accuracy of the movement based on calibration between camera space and the robot’s world space.

## Tech Stack

- C++
- Aubo SDK
- YOLOv5
- OpenCV

I no longer have access to the physical robot setup, so this repo mainly includes code snippets and examples from the development phase.
